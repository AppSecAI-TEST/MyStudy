This is a classic DP problem, I think the most important thing is to translate this problem into a coin change problem.

The problem need you to make the chocolates to be the same, you can think the other way that you should make the number of each chocolates to become the minimum.

But the minimum may not always the key, so you should make the value from minimum - 4 to minimum.

My code is here:

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <bitset>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <list>
#include <iomanip>
#include <limits>
#include <typeinfo>
#include <functional>
#include <numeric>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;

int calc(int N) {
    int res = 0;
    res += N / 5; N = N % 5;
    res += N / 2; N = N % 2;
    res += N;
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int N, T;
    // freopen("./Equal.txt","r",stdin);
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        cin >> N;
        vector<int> nums(N, 0);
        int minNum = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            cin >> nums[j];
            minNum = min(minNum, nums[j]);
        }

        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int x = minNum - 4; x <= minNum; x++) {
            int tmp = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                tmp += calc(nums[j] - x);
            }
            res = min(tmp, res);
        }

        cout << res << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

It gets AC.
