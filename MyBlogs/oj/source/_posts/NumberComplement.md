> Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
>
> Note:
>
>   + The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
>   + You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
>
> Example 1:
> + Input: 5 Output: 2
> + Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
>
> Example 2:
> + Input: 1 Output: 0
> + Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

This is Leetcode 476. Easy problem. But here are many solutions.

You can divide the num by 2 and find the 1 bit and sum on the other hand.

It may cost O(logN) time complex.

But here I use another way:

```
class Solution {
    public:
        int findComplement(int num) {
            int level = 0;
            while (pow(2, level) <= num) {
                level++;
            }
            return (int)(pow(2, level) - 1) ^ num;
        }
};
```

You can find that 0x101 ^ 0x111 = 0x010

So, That's what I use. And it gets AC.
